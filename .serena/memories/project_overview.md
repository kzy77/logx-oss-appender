LogX OSS Appender is a Java 8 multi-module Maven workspace that ships appenders for Logback, Log4j 1.x, and Log4j2 plus a shared logx-producer (queue/batching engine) and a logx-s3-adapter that streams logs to S3-compatible storage (Alibaba OSS, AWS S3, Tencent COS, MinIO, SF OSS). The repo also includes all-in-one shaded JARs for non-Maven users and compatibility-tests covering Spring Boot/MVC/JSP and multi-framework scenarios.
