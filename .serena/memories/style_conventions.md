Coding style: Google Java Style (see docs/architecture/coding-standards.md), braces required on all control flow, no trailing inline comments, comments/doc placed above code, PascalCase classes, lowerCamelCase members/methods, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE constants. Prefer cohesive small methods, builders/config objects instead of long parameter lists, and keep appenders thin while pushing logic into producer/adapter modules.
