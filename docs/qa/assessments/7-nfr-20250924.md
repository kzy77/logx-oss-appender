# NFR Assessment: Story 7 - Web框架兼容性验证

Date: 2025-09-24
Assessed by: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Security Assessment

**Status**: PASS
**Notes**: No security issues were identified in the test implementations. The compatibility test applications follow standard practices for web framework integration testing and don't introduce any security vulnerabilities.

## Performance Assessment

**Status**: CONCERNS
**Notes**: Performance benchmarks have been implemented for all frameworks (Spring Boot, Spring MVC, JSP/Servlet, and cross-framework comparison), but the actual benchmark execution and reporting functionality needs enhancement to provide meaningful performance consistency validation.

## Reliability Assessment

**Status**: PASS
**Notes**: The test applications are reliable and follow established patterns for framework compatibility testing. No reliability issues were identified in the implementations.

## Maintainability Assessment

**Status**: PASS
**Notes**: The code is well-structured and maintainable. The configuration files are consistent across different frameworks, which demonstrates good design. The code follows the established coding standards with proper Chinese comments and documentation.

## Overall NFR Status

The implementation generally meets the non-functional requirements, with the exception of performance validation which needs improvement. The security, reliability, and maintainability aspects are well-addressed.
