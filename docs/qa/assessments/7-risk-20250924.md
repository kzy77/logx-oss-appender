## Risk Summary

| Risk Category | Count |
|---------------|-------|
| Critical | 0 |
| High | 0 |
| Medium | 2 |
| Low | 1 |

## Medium Risks

### TEST-001: Minimal Test Coverage
- **Description**: The compatibility test modules have minimal test coverage that doesn't adequately validate framework compatibility
- **Impact**: Potential undetected compatibility issues in production
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Enhance test coverage to properly validate framework compatibility

### TEST-002: Inadequate Multi-Framework Coexistence Testing
- **Description**: The multi-framework coexistence test only checks class existence rather than actual coexistence verification
- **Impact**: Potential runtime issues when multiple frameworks are used together
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper integration tests to verify actual coexistence

## Low Risks

### TEST-003: Performance Benchmark Execution
- **Description**: Performance benchmarks have been implemented but execution and reporting functionality needs enhancement
- **Impact**: Inability to validate performance consistency across frameworks
- **Likelihood**: Low
- **Mitigation**: Add actual benchmark execution and meaningful reporting

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Enhance test coverage for all compatibility test modules
2. **Immediate**: Implement proper integration tests for multi-framework coexistence verification
3. **Future**: Add performance benchmark execution and reporting
